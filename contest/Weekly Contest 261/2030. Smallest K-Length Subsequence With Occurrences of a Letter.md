# 2030. Smallest K-Length Subsequence With Occurrences of a Letter

> You are given a string `s`, an integer `k`, a letter `letter`, and an integer `repetition`.
>
> Return *the **lexicographically smallest** subsequence of* `s` *of length* `k` *that has the letter* `letter` *appear **at least*** `repetition` *times*. The test cases are generated so that the `letter` appears in `s` **at least** `repetition` times.
>
> A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
>
> A string `a` is **lexicographically smaller** than a string `b` if in the first position where `a` and `b` differ, string `a` has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in `b`.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "leet", k = 3, letter = "e", repetition = 1
> Output: "eet"
> Explanation: There are four subsequences of length 3 that have the letter 'e' appear at least 1 time:
> - "lee" (from "leet")
> - "let" (from "leet")
> - "let" (from "leet")
> - "eet" (from "leet")
> The lexicographically smallest subsequence among them is "eet".
> ```

> **Example 2:**

>
> ```
> Input: s = "leetcode", k = 4, letter = "e", repetition = 2
> Output: "ecde"
> Explanation: "ecde" is the lexicographically smallest subsequence of length 4 that has the letter "e" appear at least 2 times.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "bb", k = 2, letter = "b", repetition = 2
> Output: "bb"
> Explanation: "bb" is the only subsequence of length 2 that has the letter "b" appear at least 2 times.
> ```

>  
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - `1 <= repetition <= k <= s.length <= 5 * 104`
> - `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
> - `letter` is a lowercase English letter, and appears in `s` at least `repetition` times.

参考回答：[Python/Java O(N) greedy solution using a stack - LeetCode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-k-length-subsequence-with-occurrences-of-a-letter/discuss/1500174/PythonJava-O(N)-greedy-solution-using-a-stack)

核心思想是遍历字符串的过程中维护一个栈，一般来说，如果当前遍历到的字符比栈顶字符小，则 pop 栈，并加入当前字符。然后加入对题目要求的考虑，即长度为 k、letter 出现 repetition 次。代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def smallestSubsequence(self, s: str, k: int, letter: str, repetition: int) -> str:
        n_letters = len([c for c in s if c==letter])
        n = len(s)
        letter_cnt = 0
        stack = []
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if len(stack) == 0 or n - i + len(stack) <= k:
                stack.append(s[i])
                letter_cnt += (s[i]==letter)  
            else:
                while len(stack) > max(0, k-(n-i)) and stack[-1] > s[i]:
                    if n - i + len(stack) > k and (stack[-1] != letter or (n_letters > repetition - letter_cnt)):
                        c = stack.pop()
                        letter_cnt -= (c==letter)
                    else:
                        break
                while len(stack) > max(0, k-(n-i)) and s[i] == letter and k - len(stack) < repetition - letter_cnt:
                        c = stack.pop()
                        letter_cnt -= (c==letter)  
                if len(stack) < k:
                    stack.append(s[i])
                    letter_cnt += (s[i]==letter)  
                          
            n_letters -= (s[i]==letter)
                
        return "".join(stack)
```
