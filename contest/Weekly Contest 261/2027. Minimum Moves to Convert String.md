# 2027. Minimum Moves to Convert String

> You are given a string `s` consisting of `n` characters which are either `'X'` or `'O'`.
>
> A **move** is defined as selecting **three** **consecutive characters** of `s` and converting them to `'O'`. Note that if a move is applied to the character `'O'`, it will stay the **same**.
>
> Return *the **minimum** number of moves required so that all the characters of* `s` *are converted to* `'O'`.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "XXX"
> Output: 1
> Explanation: XXX -> OOO
> We select all the 3 characters and convert them in one move.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "XXOX"
> Output: 2
> Explanation: XXOX -> OOOX -> OOOO
> We select the first 3 characters in the first move, and convert them to 'O'.
> Then we select the last 3 characters and convert them so that the final string contains all 'O's.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "OOOO"
> Output: 0
> Explanation: There are no 'X's in s to convert.
> ```
>
>  
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - `3 <= s.length <= 1000`
> - `s[i]` is either `'X'` or `'O'`.

从头开始扫一遍 ``s``，如果当前字母是 ``o``，则前进一步，否则前进三步。代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumMoves(self, s: str) -> int:
        idx = 0
        cnt = 0
        while idx < len(s):
            if s[idx] == "X":
                cnt += 1
                idx += 3
            else:
                idx += 1
        return cnt
```
