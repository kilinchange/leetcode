# 2014. Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times

> You are given a string `s` of length `n`, and an integer `k`. You are tasked to find the **longest subsequence repeated** `k` times in string `s`.
>
> A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
>
> A subsequence `seq` is **repeated** `k` times in the string `s` if `seq * k` is a subsequence of `s`, where `seq * k` represents a string constructed by concatenating `seq` `k` times.
>
> - For example, `"bba"` is repeated `2` times in the string `"bababcba"`, because the string `"bbabba"`, constructed by concatenating `"bba"` `2` times, is a subsequence of the string `"**b**a**bab**c**ba**"`.
>
> Return *the **longest subsequence repeated*** `k` *times in string* `s`*. If multiple such subsequences are found, return the **lexicographically largest** one. If there is no such subsequence, return an **empty** string*.

参考回答：[[Python\] Answer is not so long, explained - LeetCode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-repeated-k-times/discuss/1471930/Python-Answer-is-not-so-long-explained)

学会了py的几个好用的库函数``itertools.combinations(iterable,r)``，``itertools.permutations(iterable,r)``，``collections.Counter``，还有自定义的判断是否是子串的``isSubsequence``函数，使用迭代器比一趟扫下来要快。

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def longestSubsequenceRepeatedK(self, s: str, k: int) -> str:
        n = len(s)
        chs = "".join(c*(fre//k) for c,fre in Counter(s).items())
        cands = set()
        for i in range(len(chs)+1):
            for com in combinations(chs, i):
                for per in permutations(com):
                    cands.add("".join(per))
        cands = sorted(cands, key = lambda x: (len(x), x), reverse = True)
        for cand in cands:
            if isSubsequence(cand*k, s):
                return cand
        return ""

def isSubsequence(sub: str, s: str) -> bool:
    t = iter(s)
    return all(c in t for c in sub)
```
