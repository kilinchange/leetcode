# 5714. Evaluate the Bracket Pairs of a String

> You are given a string `s` that contains some bracket pairs, with each pair containing a **non-empty** key.
>
> - For example, in the string `"(name)is(age)yearsold"`, there are **two** bracket pairs that contain the keys `"name"` and `"age"`.
>
> You know the values of a wide range of keys. This is represented by a 2D string array `knowledge` where each `knowledge[i] = [keyi, valuei]` indicates that key `keyi` has a value of `valuei`.
>
> You are tasked to evaluate **all** of the bracket pairs. When you evaluate a bracket pair that contains some key `keyi`, you will:
>
> - Replace `keyi` and the bracket pair with the key's corresponding `valuei`.
> - If you do not know the value of the key, you will replace `keyi` and the bracket pair with a question mark `"?"` (without the quotation marks).
>
> Each key will appear at most once in your `knowledge`. There will not be any nested brackets in `s`.
>
> Return *the resulting string after evaluating **all** of the bracket pairs.*
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "(name)is(age)yearsold", knowledge = [["name","bob"],["age","two"]]
> Output: "bobistwoyearsold"
> Explanation:
> The key "name" has a value of "bob", so replace "(name)" with "bob".
> The key "age" has a value of "two", so replace "(age)" with "two".
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "hi(name)", knowledge = [["a","b"]]
> Output: "hi?"
> Explanation: As you do not know the value of the key "name", replace "(name)" with "?".
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "(a)(a)(a)aaa", knowledge = [["a","yes"]]
> Output: "yesyesyesaaa"
> Explanation: The same key can appear multiple times.
> The key "a" has a value of "yes", so replace all occurrences of "(a)" with "yes".
> Notice that the "a"s not in a bracket pair are not evaluated.
> ```
>
> **Example 4:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "(a)(b)", knowledge = [["a","b"],["b","a"]]
> Output: "ba"
> ```

先用字典结构存储``knowledge``，然后扫一遍，用一个列表存储之后需要拼接起来的单个单词。代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def evaluate(self, s: str, knowledge: List[List[str]]) -> str:
        memo = {}
        for pair in knowledge:
            memo[pair[0]] = pair[1]
        words = []
        temp = ""
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == "(":
                if temp != "":
                    words.append(temp)
                    temp = ""
            elif s[i] == ")":
                if temp != "":
                    words.append(memo[temp] if temp in memo.keys() else "?")
                    temp = ""
            else:
                temp += s[i]
        if temp:
            words.append(temp)
        return "".join(words)
```
