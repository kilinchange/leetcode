# 5716. Maximize Number of Nice Divisors

> - You are given a positive integer `primeFactors`. You are asked to construct a positive integer `n` that satisfies the following conditions:
>
>   - The number of prime factors of `n` (not necessarily distinct) is **at most** `primeFactors`.
>   - The number of nice divisors of `n` is maximized. Note that a divisor of `n` is **nice** if it is divisible by every prime factor of `n`. For example, if `n = 12`, then its prime factors are `[2,2,3]`, then `6` and `12` are nice divisors, while `3` and `4` are not.
>
>   Return *the number of nice divisors of* `n`. Since that number can be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.
>
>   Note that a prime number is a natural number greater than `1` that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. The prime factors of a number `n` is a list of prime numbers such that their product equals `n`.

>   **Example 1:**
>
>   ```
>   Input: primeFactors = 5
>   Output: 6
>   Explanation: 200 is a valid value of n.
>   It has 5 prime factors: [2,2,2,5,5], and it has 6 nice divisors: [10,20,40,50,100,200].
>   There is not other value of n that has at most 5 prime factors and more nice divisors.

>   **Example 2:**

>   ```
>   Input: primeFactors = 8
>   Output: 18

>   - `1 <= primeFactors <= 109`

设$n=p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}...p_k^{\alpha_k}$ ,则$n$的``nice divisors``的个数为$\alpha_1\times\alpha_2\times...\alpha_k$，且$\alpha_1+\alpha_2+...\alpha_n\le primeFactors$，则问题转换为一个经典地分割绳子的问题，答案是尽可能把``primeFactors``分成若干个3，当无法被3整除时分类讨论一下。代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def maxNiceDivisors(self, primeFactors: int) -> int:
        mod = int(1e9 + 7)
        res = 0
        if primeFactors == 1:
            return 1
        if primeFactors == 2:
            return 2
        if primeFactors % 3 == 0:
            res = fast(3, primeFactors // 3, mod)
        elif primeFactors % 3 == 1:
            res = fast(3, (primeFactors - 4) // 3, mod) * 4
        else:
            res = fast(3, (primeFactors - 2) // 3, mod) * 2
        return res % int(1e9+7)

def fast(base, exp, mod):
    res = 1
    while exp:
        if exp & 1 == 1:
            res *= base
        base = (base * base) % mod
        exp = (exp >> 1) % mod
    return res
```

这里要用到取余快速幂，注意快速幂算法中取余的两个位置。
