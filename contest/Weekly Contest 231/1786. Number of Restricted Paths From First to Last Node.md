# 1786. Number of Restricted Paths From First to Last Node

> There is an undirected weighted connected graph. You are given a positive integer `n` which denotes that the graph has `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, and an array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi, weighti]` denotes that there is an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi` with weight equal to `weighti`.
>
> A path from node `start` to node `end` is a sequence of nodes `[z0, z1, z2, ..., zk]` such that `z0 = start` and `zk = end` and there is an edge between `zi` and `zi+1` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.
>
> The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path. Let `distanceToLastNode(x)` denote the shortest distance of a path between node `n` and node `x`. A **restricted path** is a path that also satisfies that `distanceToLastNode(zi) > distanceToLastNode(zi+1)` where `0 <= i <= k-1`.
>
> Return *the number of restricted paths from node* `1` *to node* `n`. Since that number may be too large, return it **modulo** `109 + 7`.

> Input: n = 5, edges = [[1,2,3],[1,3,3],[2,3,1],[1,4,2],[5,2,2],[3,5,1],[5,4,10]]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: Each circle contains the node number in black and its distanceToLastNode value in blue. The three restricted paths are:
> 1) 1 --> 2 --> 5
> 2) 1 --> 2 --> 3 --> 5
> 3) 1 --> 3 --> 5

> Output: 1
> Explanation: Each circle contains the node number in black and its distanceToLastNode value in blue. The only restricted path is 1 --> 3 --> 7.

> **Constraints:**
>
> - `1 <= n <= 2 * 104`
> - `n - 1 <= edges.length <= 4 * 104`
> - `edges[i].length == 3`
> - `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
> - `ui != vi`
> - `1 <= weighti <= 105`
> - There is at most one edge between any two nodes.
> - There is at least one path between any two nodes.

Dijkstra + DFS with memo，代码如下：

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def countRestrictedPaths(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        graph = collections.defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, w in edges:
            graph[u].append((v, w))
            graph[v].append((u, w))
        distance = [-1] * (n + 1)
        pq = [(0, n)]
        while pq:
            dis, u = heapq.heappop(pq)
            if distance[u] == -1:
                distance[u] = dis
                for v, w in graph[u]:
                    if distance[v] == -1:
                        heapq.heappush(pq, (dis + w, v))
        def dfs(idx: int) -> int:
            if idx == 1:
                return 1
            if idx not in memo:
                memo[idx] = sum(dfs(v) for v, w in graph[idx] if distance[v] > distance[idx])
            return memo[idx]
        memo = collections.defaultdict(int)
        return dfs(n) % int(1e9+7)
