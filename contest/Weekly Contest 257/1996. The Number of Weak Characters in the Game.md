# 1996. The Number of Weak Characters in the Game

> You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each of the characters has **two** main properties: **attack** and **defense**. You are given a 2D integer array `properties` where `properties[i] = [attacki, defensei]` represents the properties of the `ith` character in the game.
>
> A character is said to be **weak** if any other character has **both** attack and defense levels **strictly greater** than this character's attack and defense levels. More formally, a character `i` is said to be **weak** if there exists another character `j` where `attackj > attacki` and `defensej > defensei`.
>
> Return *the number of **weak** characters*.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: properties = [[5,5],[6,3],[3,6]]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: No character has strictly greater attack and defense than the other.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: properties = [[2,2],[3,3]]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: The first character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: properties = [[1,5],[10,4],[4,3]]
> Output: 1
> Explanation: The third character is weak because the second character has a strictly greater attack and defense.
> ```
>
>  
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - `2 <= properties.length <= 105`
> - `properties[i].length == 2`
> - `1 <= attacki, defensei <= 105`

先将二维数组按``attack``值排序，然后从后往前扫描数组，并记录``max_val``和``next_max_val``值：

1.  ``max_val``：``attack``值大于当前扫描元素的所有元素里，最大的``defense``值；
2. ``next_max_val``：``attack``值==大于等于==当前扫描元素的所有元素里，最大的``defense``值。

若当前元素的``defense``值小于``max_val``，则找到一个 weak characters，代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def numberOfWeakCharacters(self, properties: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        properties.sort()
        max_val = -1
        next_max_val = properties[-1][1]
        cnt = 0
        for i in range(len(properties)-2, -1, -1):
            if properties[i][0] < properties[i+1][0]:
                max_val = next_max_val             
            curr_val = properties[i][1]
            if curr_val >= max_val:
                next_max_val = max(next_max_val, curr_val)
            else:
                cnt += 1           
        return cnt
```
