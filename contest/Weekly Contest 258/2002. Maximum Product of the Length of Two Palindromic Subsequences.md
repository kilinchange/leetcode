# 2002. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Subsequences

> Given a string `s`, find two **disjoint palindromic subsequences** of `s` such that the **product** of their lengths is **maximized**. The two subsequences are **disjoint** if they do not both pick a character at the same index.
>
> Return *the **maximum** possible **product** of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences*.
>
> A **subsequence** is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters. A string is **palindromic** if it reads the same forward and backward.

>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ![example-1](https://assets.leetcode.com/uploads/2021/08/24/two-palindromic-subsequences.png)
>
> ```
> Input: s = "leetcodecom"
> Output: 9
> Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "ete" for the 1st subsequence and "cdc" for the 2nd subsequence.
> The product of their lengths is: 3 * 3 = 9.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "bb"
> Output: 1
> Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "b" (the first character) for the 1st subsequence and "b" (the second character) for the 2nd subsequence.
> The product of their lengths is: 1 * 1 = 1.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "accbcaxxcxx"
> Output: 25
> Explanation: An optimal solution is to choose "accca" for the 1st subsequence and "xxcxx" for the 2nd subsequence.
> The product of their lengths is: 5 * 5 = 25.
> ```
>
>  
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - `2 <= s.length <= 12`
> - `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.

利用掩码记录所有回文子串，然后做``&``运算判断是否不相交，代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, s: str) -> int:
        n = len(s)
        arr = []
        for mask in range(1 << n):
            curr_s = ""
            for i in range(n):
                if mask & (1 << i):
                    curr_s += s[i]
            if curr_s == curr_s[::-1]:
                arr.append((mask, len(curr_s)))
        res = 0
        for x, y in product(arr, arr):
            if not (x[0] & y[0]):
                res = max(res, x[1] * y[1])
        return res
```
