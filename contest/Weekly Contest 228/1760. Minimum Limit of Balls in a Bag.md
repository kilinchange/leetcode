# 1760. Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag

> You are given an integer array `nums` where the `ith` bag contains `nums[i]` balls. You are also given an integer `maxOperations`.
>
> You can perform the following operation at most `maxOperations` times:
>
> - Take any bag of balls and divide it into two new bags with a

>   positive 
>
>   number of balls.
>
>   - For example, a bag of `5` balls can become two new bags of `1` and `4` balls, or two new bags of `2` and `3` balls.
>
> Your penalty is the **maximum** number of balls in a bag. You want to **minimize** your penalty after the operations.
>
> Return *the minimum possible penalty after performing the operations*.

> Input: nums = [9], maxOperations = 2
> Output: 3
> Explanation: 
> - Divide the bag with 9 balls into two bags of sizes 6 and 3. [9] -> [6,3].
> - Divide the bag with 6 balls into two bags of sizes 3 and 3. [6,3] -> [3,3,3].
> The bag with the most number of balls has 3 balls, so your penalty is 3 and you should return 3.

> **Example 2:**

> ```
> Input: nums = [2,4,8,2], maxOperations = 4
> Output: 2
> Explanation:
> - Divide the bag with 8 balls into two bags of sizes 4 and 4. [2,4,8,2] -> [2,4,4,4,2].
> - Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,4,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,4,4,2].
> - Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,4,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,4,2].
> - Divide the bag with 4 balls into two bags of sizes 2 and 2. [2,2,2,2,2,4,2] -> [2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2].
> The bag with the most number of balls has 2 balls, so your penalty is 2 an you should return 2.

> **Example 3:**

> ```
> Input: nums = [7,17], maxOperations = 2
> Output: 7

> **Constraints:**

> - `1 <= nums.length <= 105`
> - `1 <= maxOperations, nums[i] <= 109`

二分答案，（技巧：事先定义一个res，在二分过程中修改）。代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumSize(self, nums: List[int], maxOperations: int) -> int:
        l, h = 1, max(nums)
        res = h
        while l < h:
            mid = (l + h) // 2
            val = functools.reduce(lambda x, y : x+(y+mid-1)//mid-1, nums, 0)
            if val <= maxOperations:
                res = mid
                h = mid
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return res
```
