# 1758. Minimum Changes To Make Alternating Binary String

> You are given a string `s` consisting only of the characters `'0'` and `'1'`. In one operation, you can change any `'0'` to `'1'` or vice versa.
>
> The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal. For example, the string `"010"` is alternating, while the string `"0100"` is not.
>
> Return *the **minimum** number of operations needed to make* `s` *alternating*.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "0100"
> Output: 1
> Explanation: If you change the last character to '1', s will be "0101", which is alternating.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "10"
> Output: 0
> Explanation: s is already alternating.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: s = "1111"
> Output: 2
> Explanation: You need two operations to reach "0101" or "1010".
> ```
>
>  
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - `1 <= s.length <= 104`
> - `s[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

``Alternating Binary String`` 要么是0开头，要么是1开头，分两类讨论即可。代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, s: str) -> int:
        res1, res2 = 0, 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != '0':
                res1 += 1
            if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != '1':
                res1 += 1
            if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != '1':
                res2 += 1
            if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != '0':
                res2 += 1
        return min(res1, res2)
```
