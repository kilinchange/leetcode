# 1771. Maximize Palindrome Length From Subsequences

> You are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string in the following manner:
>
> - Choose some **non-empty** subsequence `subsequence1` from `word1`.
> - Choose some **non-empty** subsequence `subsequence2` from `word2`.
> - Concatenate the subsequences: `subsequence1 + subsequence2`, to make the string.
>
> Return *the **length** of the longest **palindrome** that can be constructed in the described manner.* If no palindromes can be constructed, return `0`.
>
> A **subsequence** of a string `s` is a string that can be made by deleting some (possibly none) characters from `s` without changing the order of the remaining characters.
>
> A **palindrome** is a string that reads the same forward as well as backward.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: word1 = "cacb", word2 = "cbba"
> Output: 5
> Explanation: Choose "ab" from word1 and "cba" from word2 to make "abcba", which is a palindrome.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: word1 = "ab", word2 = "ab"
> Output: 3
> Explanation: Choose "ab" from word1 and "a" from word2 to make "aba", which is a palindrome.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: word1 = "aa", word2 = "bb"
> Output: 0
> Explanation: You cannot construct a palindrome from the described method, so return 0.
> ```
>
>  
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 1000`
> - `word1` and `word2` consist of lowercase English letters.

最长回文子序列的动态转移方程：
$$
dp[i][j]=\begin{cases}
dp[i+1][j-1]+2& \text{if s[i]==s[j]}\\
max(dp[i][j-1],dp[i+1][j])& \text{else}
\end{cases}
$$
本题是最长回文子序列的变体，额外维护一个指示是否两个子序列都非空的状态表示即可。代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def longestPalindrome(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        n1, n2 = len(word1), len(word2)
        n = n1 + n2
        word = word1 + word2
        dp = [[[0, False] for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n):
            dp[i][i] = [1, False]
        res = 0
        for i in reversed(range(n)):
            for j in range(i+1, n):
                if word[i] == word[j]:
                    is_ok = i < n1 and j >= n1
                    dp[i][j] = [dp[i+1][j-1][0] + 2, dp[i+1][j-1][1] or is_ok]
                    if dp[i][j][1]:
                        res = max(res, dp[i][j][0])
                else:
                    if dp[i][j-1][0] > dp[i+1][j][0]:
                        dp[i][j][0] = dp[i][j-1][0]
                        dp[i][j][1] = dp[i][j-1][1]
                    elif dp[i][j-1][0] < dp[i+1][j][0]:
                        dp[i][j][0] = dp[i+1][j][0]
                        dp[i][j][1] = dp[i+1][j][1]
                    else:
                        dp[i][j][0] = dp[i+1][j][0]
                        dp[i][j][1] = dp[i][j-1][1] and dp[i+1][j][1]
        return res
```
