# 1739. Building Boxes

> You have a cubic storeroom where the width, length, and height of the room are all equal to `n` units. You are asked to place `n` boxes in this room where each box is a cube of unit side length. There are however some rules to placing the boxes:
>
> - You can place the boxes anywhere on the floor.
> - If box `x` is placed on top of the box `y`, then each side of the four vertical sides of the box `y` **must** either be adjacent to another box or to a wall.
>
> Given an integer `n`, return *the **minimum** possible number of boxes touching the floor.*

问题转换为将 n 表示为``n = 1 + (1 + 2) + ... + (1 + 2 + ... + j)``，则答案为``(1 + 2 + ... + j)``。

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def minimumBoxes(self, n: int) -> int:
        curr, i, j = 0, 0, 0
        while curr < n:
            j += 1
            i += j
            curr += i
        if curr == n:
            return i
        curr -= i
        i -= j
        j = 0
        while curr < n:
            j += 1
            curr += j
        return i + j 
```
