# 1737. Change Minimum Characters to Satisfy One of Three Conditions

> You are given two strings `a` and `b` that consist of lowercase letters. In one operation, you can change any character in `a` or `b` to **any lowercase letter**.
>
> Your goal is to satisfy **one** of the following three conditions:
>
> - **Every** letter in `a` is **strictly less** than **every** letter in `b` in the alphabet.
> - **Every** letter in `b` is **strictly less** than **every** letter in `a` in the alphabet.
> - **Both** `a` and `b` consist of **only one** distinct letter.
>
> Return *the **minimum** number of operations needed to achieve your goal.*
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: a = "aba", b = "caa"
> Output: 2
> Explanation: Consider the best way to make each condition true:
> 1) Change b to "ccc" in 2 operations, then every letter in a is less than every letter in b.
> 2) Change a to "bbb" and b to "aaa" in 3 operations, then every letter in b is less than every letter in a.
> 3) Change a to "aaa" and b to "aaa" in 2 operations, then a and b consist of one distinct letter.
> The best way was done in 2 operations (either condition 1 or condition 3).
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: a = "dabadd", b = "cda"
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The best way is to make condition 1 true by changing b to "eee".
> ```
>
>  
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - `1 <= a.length, b.length <= 105`
> - `a` and `b` consist only of lowercase letters.

参考讨论区回答 [Java/C++/Python\] Clean Solution - LeetCode Discuss](https://leetcode.com/problems/change-minimum-characters-to-satisfy-one-of-three-conditions/discuss/1032070/JavaC%2B%2BPython-Clean-Solution)

设 a 的长度为 m，b 的长度为 n，c1 和 c2 分别是统计 a 和 b 中各个字母出现频率的数据结构，利用 c1 和 c2 可以计算出在两个字符串中最常出现的字母的出现次数为 ``most_common=max((c1+c2).values())``，所以满足条件3需要的修改次数是``m+n-most_common``；列举 {a, b, c, ..., x, y, z}，设当前字符为$\sigma$，设修改后的 a 和 b 以字符$\sigma$为分界点，计算需要修改的次数。==注意计数器Counter的使用==。

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def minCharacters(self, a: str, b: str) -> int:
        c1 = Counter(ord(c) - 97 for c in a)
        c2 = Counter(ord(c) - 97 for c in b)
        m = len(a)
        n = len(b)
        res = m + n - max((c1 + c2).values())  # condition 3
        for i in range(25):
            c1[i+1] += c1[i]       
            c2[i+1] += c2[i]
            res = min(m - c1[i] + c2[i], res)    # condition 1
            res = min(n -c2[i] + c1[i], res)     # condition 2
        return res
```
