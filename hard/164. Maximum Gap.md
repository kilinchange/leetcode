# 164. Maximum Gap

> Given an unsorted array, find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.
>
> Return 0 if the array contains less than 2 elements.
>
> Example 1:
>
> Input: [3,6,9,1]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The sorted form of the array is [1,3,6,9], either
>              (3,6) or (6,9) has the maximum difference 3.
> Example 2:
>
> Input: [10]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: The array contains less than 2 elements, therefore return 0.
> Note:
>
> You may assume all elements in the array are non-negative integers and fit in the 32-bit signed integer range.
> Try to solve it in linear time/space.

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def maximumGap(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        nums.sort()
        if (len(nums) < 2):
            return 0
        result = nums[1] - nums[0]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            result = max(nums[i] - nums[i-1], result)
        return result
```
