# 174. Dungeon Game

> The demons had captured the princess (P) and imprisoned her in the bottom-right corner of a dungeon. The dungeon consists of M x N rooms laid out in a 2D grid. Our valiant knight (K) was initially positioned in the top-left room and must fight his way through the dungeon to rescue the princess.
>
> The knight has an initial health point represented by a positive integer. If at any point his health point drops to 0 or below, he dies immediately.
>
> Some of the rooms are guarded by demons, so the knight loses health (negative integers) upon entering these rooms; other rooms are either empty (0's) or contain magic orbs that increase the knight's health (positive integers).
>
> In order to reach the princess as quickly as possible, the knight decides to move only rightward or downward in each step.
>
>  
>
> Write a function to determine the knight's minimum initial health so that he is able to rescue the princess.
>
> For example, given the dungeon below, the initial health of the knight must be at least 7 if he follows the optimal path RIGHT-> RIGHT -> DOWN -> DOWN.
>
> -2 (K)	-3	3
> -5	-10	1
> 10	30	-5 (P)
>
>
> Note:
>
> The knight's health has no upper bound.
> Any room can contain threats or power-ups, even the first room the knight enters and the bottom-right room where the princess is imprisoned.

动态规划。这题如果从左上角开始考虑，动态数组维护从左上角出发到达每一点所需最小初始生命值的话，由于从该点到达右下角的路径情况是无法预测的，而能否到达右下角还与当前点余下的生命值有关，问题就比较棘手了。而从右下角开始考虑的话，就会顺利很多。

代码如下：

```python
import numpy as np
class Solution:
    def calculateMinimumHP(self, dungeon: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = len(dungeon)
        n = len(dungeon[0])
        dp = np.zeros((m, n))
        dp[-1, -1] = max(1 - dungeon[-1][-1], 1)
        for i in range(m-2, -1, -1):
            dp[i, -1] = max(dp[i+1, -1] - dungeon[i][-1], 1)
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            dp[-1, i] = max(dp[-1, i+1] - dungeon[-1][i], 1)
        for i in range(m-2, -1, -1):
            for j in range(n-2, -1, -1):
                dp[i, j] = min(max(dp[i+1, j] - dungeon[i][j], 1), max(dp[i, j+1] - dungeon[i][j], 1))
        return int(dp[0, 0])
```
