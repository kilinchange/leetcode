# 135. Candy

> There are N children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.
>
> You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:
>
> Each child must have at least one candy.
> Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
> What is the minimum candies you must give?
>
> Example 1:
>
> Input: [1,0,2]
> Output: 5
> Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 2, 1, 2 candies respectively.
> Example 2:
>
> Input: [1,2,2]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: You can allocate to the first, second and third child with 1, 2, 1 candies respectively.
>              The third child gets 1 candy because it satisfies the above two conditions.

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def candy(self, ratings: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(ratings) == 1:
            return 1
        nums = [0] * len(ratings)
        pre = (1 if ratings[0] <= ratings[1] else 2)
        nums[0] = pre
        for i in range(1, len(ratings)):
            if ratings[i] <= ratings[i-1]:
                nums[i] = (1 if ratings[i] <= ratings[i-1] else 2)
                pre = nums[i]
            else:
                nums[i] = pre + 1
                pre += 1
        pre = (1 if ratings[-1] <= ratings[-2] else 2)
        nums[-1] = max(pre, nums[-1])
        for i in range(len(ratings)-2, -1, -1):
            if ratings[i] <= ratings[i+1]:
                pre = (1 if ratings[i] <= ratings[i+1] else 2)
                nums[i] = max(pre, nums[i])
            else:
                pre += 1
                nums[i] = max(pre, nums[i])
        return sum(nums)
```
