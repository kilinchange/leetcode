# 68. Text Justification

> Given an array of words and a width *maxWidth*, format the text such that each line has exactly *maxWidth* characters and is fully (left and right) justified.
>
> You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly *maxWidth* characters.
>
> Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.
>
> For the last line of text, it should be left justified and no **extra** space is inserted between words.
>
> **Note:**
>
> - A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
> - Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed *maxWidth*.
> - The input array `words` contains at least one word.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input:
> words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."]
> maxWidth = 16
> Output:
> [
>    "This    is    an",
>    "example  of text",
>    "justification.  "
> ]
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input:
> words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"]
> maxWidth = 16
> Output:
> [
>   "What   must   be",
>   "acknowledgment  ",
>   "shall be        "
> ]
> Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be",
>              because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
>              Note that the second line is also left-justified becase it contains only one word.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input:
> words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain",
>          "to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"]
> maxWidth = 20
> Output:
> [
>   "Science  is  what we",
>   "understand      well",
>   "enough to explain to",
>   "a  computer.  Art is",
>   "everything  else  we",
>   "do                  "
> ]

顺着扫一遍，一边扫一边判断即可。

代码如下：

```python
