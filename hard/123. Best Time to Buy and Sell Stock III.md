# 123. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III

> Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.
>
> Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete at most *two* transactions.
>
> **Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]
> Output: 6
> Explanation: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
>              Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
>              Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
>              engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
> Output: 0
> Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
> ```

扫一遍，先后维护第一次的买入价、利润和第二次的买入价、利润，且第二次的买入价格用实际买入价格减去第一次交易的利润，这样两次交易的利润都计算在了第二次交易的利润上。且保证了第二次交易发生在第一次交易之后。

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        buy1 = sys.maxsize
        sell1 = 0
        buy2 = sys.maxsize
        sell2 = 0
        for i in range(len(prices)):
            buy1 = min(buy1, prices[i])
            sell1 = max(sell1, prices[i] - buy1)
            buy2 = min(buy2, prices[i] - sell1)
            sell2 = max(sell2, prices[i] - buy2)
        return sell2
```
