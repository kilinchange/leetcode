# 42. Trapping Rain Water

> Given *n* non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it is able to trap after raining.

> The above elevation map is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped. **Thanks Marcos** for contributing this image!

每一个点对应的水位是min(左边最大数，右边最大数)。

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        tmp = -1
        water = []
        for i in range(len(height)):
            if height[i] > tmp:
                tmp = height[i]
            water.append(tmp)
        tmp = -1
        for i in range(len(height)-1, -1, -1):
            if height[i] > tmp:
                tmp = height[i]
            water[i] = min(water[i], tmp)
        return sum(water) - sum(height)
```
