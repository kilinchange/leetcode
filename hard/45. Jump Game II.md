# 45. Jump Game II

> Given an array of non-negative integers, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.
>
> Each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.
>
> Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```
> Input: [2,3,1,1,4]
> Output: 2
> Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2.
>     Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
> ```
>
> **Note:**
>
> You can assume that you can always reach the last index.

在讨论区看到的做法，每次维护一个能够到达的位置范围的数组。（好巧妙~）

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def jump(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        low = 0
        high = 1
        result = 0
        while high < len(nums):
            low, high = high, max([i + nums[i] for i in range(low, high)]) + 1
            result += 1
        return result
```
