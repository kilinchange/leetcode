# 72. Edit Distance

> Given two words *word1* and *word2*, find the minimum number of operations required to convert *word1* to *word2*.
>
> You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
>
> 1. Insert a character
> 2. Delete a character
> 3. Replace a character
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: word1 = "horse", word2 = "ros"
> Output: 3
> Explanation: 
> horse -> rorse (replace 'h' with 'r')
> rorse -> rose (remove 'r')
> rose -> ros (remove 'e')
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: word1 = "intention", word2 = "execution"
> Output: 5
> Explanation: 
> intention -> inention (remove 't')
> inention -> enention (replace 'i' with 'e')
> enention -> exention (replace 'n' with 'x')
> exention -> exection (replace 'n' with 'c')
> exection -> execution (insert 'u')
> ```

编辑距离，dp。

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def minDistance(self, word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
        m = len(word1)
        n = len(word2)
        dis = []
        for j in range(n+1):
            dis.append(j)
        curr = dis.copy()
        for i in range(1, m+1):
            curr[0] = i
            for j in range(1,n+1):
                curr[j] = (min(dis[j-1] + (0 if word1[i-1] == word2[j-1] else 1), dis[j] + 1, curr[j-1] + 1))
            if i != m:
                dis, curr = curr, dis
        return int(curr[n])
```
