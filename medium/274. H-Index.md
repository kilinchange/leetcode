# 274. H-Index

> Given an array of citations (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.
>
> According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: "A scientist has index h if h of his/her N papers have at least h citations each, and the other N − h papers have no more than h citations each."
>
> Example:
>
> Input: citations = [3,0,6,1,5]
> Output: 3 
> Explanation: [3,0,6,1,5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had 
>              received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
>              Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining 
>              two with no more than 3 citations each, her h-index is 3.
> Note: If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

方法一：先排序，然后将 h 从 n-1 开始递减，判断数组中是否有至少 h 个数不小于 h ，且其余数均不大于 h，即表达式：citations[n-h-1] <= h <= citations[n-h]。

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:  
        citations.sort()
        citations.insert(0, -1)
        n = len(citations)
        for h in range(n-1, 0, -1):
            if citations[n-h-1] <= h <= citations[n-h]:
                return h
        return 0           
```

方法二：

利用直方图。

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def hIndex(self, citations: List[int]) -> int:  
        n = len(citations)
        his = [0] * (n+1)
        for i in range(n):
            his[min(n, citations[i])] += 1
        s = his[-1]
        h = n
        while s < h:
            h -= 1
            s += his[h] 
        return h
```
