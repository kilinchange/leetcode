# 138. Copy List with Random Pointer

> A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer which could point to any node in the list or null.
>
> Return a [**deep copy**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_copying#Deep_copy) of the list.
>
> The Linked List is represented in the input/output as a list of `n` nodes. Each node is represented as a pair of `[val, random_index]` where:
>
> - `val`: an integer representing `Node.val`
> - `random_index`: the index of the node (range from `0` to `n-1`) where random pointer points to, or `null` if it does not point to any node.

> ```
> Input: head = [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
> Output: [[3,null],[3,0],[3,null]]
> ```
>
> **Example 4:**
>
> ```
> Input: head = []
> Output: []
> Explanation: Given linked list is empty (null pointer), so return null.
> ```
>
>  
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - `-10000 <= Node.val <= 10000`
> - `Node.random` is null or pointing to a node in the linked list.
> - Number of Nodes will not exceed 1000.

> Hide Hint1
>
> Just iterate the linked list and create copies of the nodes on the go. Since a node can be referenced from multiple nodes due to the random pointers, make sure you are not making multiple copies of the same node.
>
> Hide Hint 2
>
> You may want to use extra space to keep **old node ---> new node** mapping to prevent creating multiples copies of same node.
>
> Hide Hint 3
>
> We can avoid using extra space for old node ---> new node mapping, by tweaking the original linked list. Simply interweave the nodes of the old and copied list. For e.g.
>
> ```
> Old List: A --> B --> C --> D
> InterWeaved List: A --> A' --> B --> B' --> C --> C' --> D --> D'
> ```
>
> Hide Hint 4
>
> The interweaving is done using **next** pointers and we can make use of interweaved structure to get the correct reference nodes for **random** pointers.

代码如下：

```python
