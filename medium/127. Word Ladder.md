# 127. Word Ladder

> Given two words (*beginWord* and *endWord*), and a dictionary's word list, find the length of shortest transformation sequence from *beginWord* to *endWord*, such that:
>
> 1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
> 2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list. Note that *beginWord* is *not* a transformed word.
>
> **Note:**
>
> - Return 0 if there is no such transformation sequence.
> - All words have the same length.
> - All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
> - You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
> - You may assume *beginWord* and *endWord* are non-empty and are not the same.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input:
> beginWord = "hit",
> endWord = "cog",
> wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
> 
> Output: 5
> 
> Explanation: As one shortest transformation is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> "cog",
> return its length 5.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input:
> beginWord = "hit"
> endWord = "cog"
> wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
> 
> Output: 0
> 
> Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore no possible transformation.

一开始是每次遍历wordList寻找可transformed的单词，但是wordList很长时每次都遍历会超时，所以改成用字典记录wordList中每一个单词可能转变的词（即替换每一位）。

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        q = []
        q.append([beginWord, 1])
        visited = []
        visited.append(beginWord)
        curr = 0
        log = dict()
        L = len(beginWord)
        for word in wordList:
            for i in range(L):
                tmp = log.get(word[:i] + '*' + word[i+1:], [])
                tmp.append(word)
                log[word[:i] + '*' + word[i+1:]] = tmp
        while len(q) > 0:
            curr_word, level = q.pop(0)
            for i in range(L):
                intermediate_word = curr_word[:i] + '*' + curr_word[i+1:]
                for word in log.get(intermediate_word, []):
                    if word == endWord:
                        return level + 1
                    if word not in visited:
                        visited.append(word)
                        q.append([word, level + 1])
        return 0
```
