# 142. Linked List Cycle II

> Given a linked list, return the node where the cycle begins. If there is no cycle, return `null`.
>
> To represent a cycle in the given linked list, we use an integer `pos` which represents the position (0-indexed) in the linked list where tail connects to. If `pos` is `-1`, then there is no cycle in the linked list.
>
> **Note:** Do not modify the linked list.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: head = [3,2,0,-4], pos = 1
> Output: tail connects to node index 1
> Explanation: There is a cycle in the linked list, where tail connects to the second node.
> ```

先使用双指针得到环的长度x，然后再用双指针（两个指针的距离为x）得到入环点（即两个指针相遇处）。

代码如下：

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        front = head
        back = head
        front_count = 0
        back_count = 0
        len_c = 0
        while front != None:
            front = front.next
            if front == None:
                break
            front = front.next
            front_count += 2
            if front == back:
                len_c = front_count - back_count
                break
            back = back.next
            back_count += 1
        front = head
        back = head
        for i in range(len_c):
            front = front.next
        #print (len_c)
        if len_c != 0:
            while True:
                if front == back:
                    return back
                front = front.next
                back = back.next
        return None
```
