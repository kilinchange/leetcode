# 309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown

> Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.
>
> Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (ie, buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times) with the following restrictions:
>
> - You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (ie, you must sell the stock before you buy again).
> - After you sell your stock, you cannot buy stock on next day. (ie, cooldown 1 day)
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```
> Input: [1,2,3,0,2]
> Output: 3 
> Explanation: transactions = [buy, sell, cooldown, buy, sell]
> ```

在网上看到一篇博客[【LeetCode】309. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Cooldown - __Neo - 博客园 (cnblogs.com)](https://www.cnblogs.com/jdneo/p/5228004.html)使用的状态机的解法，状态转移图如下：

s0即为当天不交易且手中没有股票的最佳盈利状态；s1即为当天手中有股票的最佳盈利状态；s2即为当天卖出后的最佳盈利状态，下一天将处于冷冻期不可进行操作。状态转移方程：
$$
s0[i] = max(s0[i-1], s2[i-1])\\
s1[i] = max(s1[i-1], s0[i-1]-prices[i])\\
s2[i] = s1[i-1] + prices[i]
$$
代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        if len(prices) == 0:
            return 0
        s0 = [0] * len(prices)
        s1 = [0] * len(prices)
        s2 = [0] * len(prices)
        s1[0] = -prices[0]
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            s0[i] = max(s0[i-1], s2[i-1])
            s1[i] = max(s0[i-1] - prices[i], s1[i-1])
            s2[i] = s1[i-1] + prices[i]
        return max(s0[-1], s1[-1], s2[-1])
```
