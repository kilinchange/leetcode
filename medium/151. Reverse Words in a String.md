# 151. Reverse Words in a String

> Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: "the sky is blue"
> Output: "blue is sky the"
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: "  hello world!  "
> Output: "world! hello"
> Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: "a good   example"
> Output: "example good a"
> Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

> **Note:**
>
> - A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
> - Input string may contain leading or trailing spaces. However, your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
> - You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.

利用 re 模块中的字符串分割函数。

代码如下：

```python
import re
class Solution:
    def reverseWords(self, s: str) -> str:
        s = s.strip()
        words = re.split('\s+', s)
        result = ""
        for i in range(len(words)-1, -1, -1):
            result += words[i] + ' '
        result = result.rstrip()
        return result
```
