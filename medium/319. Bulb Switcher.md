# 319. Bulb Switcher

> There are `n` bulbs that are initially off. You first turn on all the bulbs, then you turn off every second bulb.
>
> On the third round, you toggle every third bulb (turning on if it's off or turning off if it's on). For the `ith` round, you toggle every `i` bulb. For the `nth` round, you only toggle the last bulb.
>
> Return *the number of bulbs that are on after `n` rounds*.

> Input: n = 3
> Output: 1
> Explanation: At first, the three bulbs are [off, off, off].
> After the first round, the three bulbs are [on, on, on].
> After the second round, the three bulbs are [on, off, on].
> After the third round, the three bulbs are [on, off, off]. 
> So you should return 1 because there is only one bulb is on.

由题意，第 i 个灯泡将被按下 d 次开关，其中 d 是 i 的因数个数。设$i=p_1^{\alpha_1}p_2^{\alpha_2}...p_m^{\alpha_m}$，则$d=(\alpha_1+1)\times(\alpha_2+1)\times...\times(\alpha_m+1)$，要想最后灯为打开状态，则需要 d 为奇数，即$\alpha_j$均为偶数，即 i 为完全平方数。

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def bulbSwitch(self, n: int) -> int:
        res = 0
        while res * res <= n:
            res += 1
        return res - 1
```
