# 236. Lowest Common Ancestor of a Binary Tree

> Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.
>
> According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”
>
> Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

> Example 1:
>
> Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1
> Output: 3
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.
> Example 2:

> Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4
> Output: 5
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.

> All of the nodes' values will be unique.
> p and q are different and both values will exist in the binary tree.

先一边bfs一边记录各节点的父节点，然后得到从根节点分别到达 p 和 q 的路径节点，比较两组节点即可。

代码如下：

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: 'TreeNode', p: 'TreeNode', q: 'TreeNode') -> 'TreeNode':
        logs = dict()
        count = 0
        s = [root]
        logs[root] = None
        if root == q or root == p:
            return root
        while count != 2:
            node = s.pop(0)
            if node.left:
                s.append(node.left)
                logs[node.left] = node
                if node.left in {p, q}:
                    count += 1
            if node.right:
                s.append(node.right)
                logs[node.right] = node
                if node.right in {p, q}:
                    count += 1
        p_parent = logs[p]
        p_p = [p]
        while p_parent != None:
            p_p.append(p_parent)
            p_parent = logs[p_parent]
        q_parent = logs[q]
        q_p = [q]
        while q_parent != None:
            q_p.append(q_parent)
            q_parent = logs[q_parent]
        result = None
        while len(p_p) > 0 and len(q_p) > 0 and p_p[-1] == q_p[-1]:
            result = p_p.pop()
            q_p.pop()
        return result
```
