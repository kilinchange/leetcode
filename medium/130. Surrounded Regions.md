# 130. Surrounded Regions

> Given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'` (**the letter O**), capture all regions surrounded by `'X'`.
>
> A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```
> X X X X
> X O O X
> X X O X
> X O X X
> ```
>
> After running your function, the board should be:
>
> ```
> X X X X
> X X X X
> X X X X
> X O X X
> ```
>
> **Explanation:**
>
> Surrounded regions shouldn’t be on the border, which means that any `'O'` on the border of the board are not flipped to `'X'`. Any `'O'` that is not on the border and it is not connected to an `'O'` on the border will be flipped to `'X'`. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent cells connected horizontally or vertically.

```python
