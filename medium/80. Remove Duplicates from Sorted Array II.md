# 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II

> Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that duplicates appeared at most *twice* and return the new length.
>
> Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Given nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3],
> 
> Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 1, 1, 2, 2 and 3 respectively.
> 
> It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,1,2,3,3],
> 
> Your function should return length = 7, with the first seven elements of nums being modified to 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 3 and 3 respectively.
> 
> It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
> ```
>
> **Clarification:**
>
> Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?
>
> Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.
>
> Internally you can think of this:
>
> ```
> // nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
> int len = removeDuplicates(nums);
> 
> // any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
> // using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
> for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
>     print(nums[i]);
> }
> ```

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def removeDuplicates(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        curr = 0
        if len(nums) == 0:
            return 0
        pre = [nums[0], 1]
        for i in range(1, len(nums)):
            if nums[i] == pre[0]:
                pre[1] += 1
                if pre[1] <= 2:
                    curr += 1
                    nums[curr] = pre[0]
            else:
                pre[0] = nums[i]
                pre[1] = 1
                curr += 1
                nums[curr] = pre[0]
        return curr + 1
```
