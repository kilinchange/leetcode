# 75. Sort Colors

> Given an array with *n* objects colored red, white or blue, sort them **in-place** so that objects of the same color are adjacent, with the colors in the order red, white and blue.
>
> Here, we will use the integers 0, 1, and 2 to represent the color red, white, and blue respectively.
>
> **Note:** You are not suppose to use the library's sort function for this problem.

> Input: [2,0,2,1,1,0]
> Output: [0,0,1,1,2,2]

三个指针start, end, curr。

start 记录0与1的分割点（start上非0），end记录1与2的分割点（end上非2），curr记录当前扫描的位置。

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def sortColors(self, nums: List[int]) -> None:
        """
        Do not return anything, modify nums in-place instead.
        """
        start = 0
        end = len(nums) - 1
        curr = 0
        while curr <= end:
            if nums[curr] == 0:
                nums[curr] = nums[start]
                nums[start] = 0
                start += 1
                # 此时curr上只可能为0或者1
                curr += 1
            elif nums[curr] == 2:
                nums[curr] = nums[end]
                nums[end] = 2
                end -= 1
                # 此时curr上可能为0或者1，不能往前移，否则当curr为0时可能不正确
            else:
                curr += 1
            print (nums)
            print (start)
            print (end)
```
