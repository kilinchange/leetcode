# 213. House Robber II

> You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are **arranged in a circle.** That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and **it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night**.
>
> Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight **without alerting the police**.
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: [2,3,2]
> Output: 3
> Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
>              because they are adjacent houses.
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: [1,2,3,1]
> Output: 4
> Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
>              Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.

“围成一个圈” 其实就是初始化时分别考虑选择第 n 个房子抢还是选第 n-1 个房子抢，然后动规。动态转移方程： 
$$
c[i]=max(c[i+1], nums[i]+c[i+2])
$$
代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def rob(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        def dp(point: int) -> int:
            m = [0] * (len(nums)+1)
            m[point] = nums[point]
            for i in range(point-1, -1, -1):
                if i == 0 and point == n-1:
                    m[i] = m[i+1]
                else:
                    m[i] = max(m[i+1], nums[i] + m[i+2])
            return m[0]
        
        if n == 0:
            return 0
        return max(dp(n-1), dp(n-2))
```
