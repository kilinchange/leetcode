# 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree

> Given a singly linked list where elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height balanced BST.
>
> For this problem, a height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of *every* node never differ by more than 1.
>
> **Example:**
>
> ```
> Given the sorted linked list: [-10,-3,0,5,9],
> 
> One possible answer is: [0,-3,9,-10,null,5], which represents the following height balanced BST:
> 
>       0
>      / \
>    -3   9
>    /   /
>  -10  5
> ```

每次取中间的数作为根节点，递归。

代码如下：

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Solution:
    def sortedListToBST(self, head: ListNode) -> TreeNode:
        #print (head.val)
        if head == None:
            node = None
        elif head.next == None:
            node = TreeNode(head.val)
        else:
            pre = head
            curr = head
            curr_pre = head
            while pre != None and pre.next != None:
                pre = pre.next
                if pre == None:
                    break
                else:
                    pre = pre.next
                curr_pre = curr
                curr = curr.next
            print (curr.val)
            node = TreeNode(curr.val)
            curr_pre.next = None
            node.left = self.sortedListToBST(head)
            #print (curr.next.val)
            node.right = self.sortedListToBST(curr.next)
        return node
```
