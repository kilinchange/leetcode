# 207. Course Schedule

> There are a total of *n* courses you have to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`.
>
> Some courses may have prerequisites, for example to take course 0 you have to first take course 1, which is expressed as a pair: `[0,1]`
>
> Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite **pairs**, is it possible for you to finish all courses?
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: 2, [[1,0]] 
> Output: true
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
>              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
> ```

> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: 2, [[1,0],[0,1]]
> Output: false
> Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses to take. 
>              To take course 1 you should have finished course 0, and to take course 0 you should
>              also have finished course 1. So it is impossible.

> 1. The input prerequisites is a graph represented by **a list of edges**, not adjacency matrices. Read more about [how a graph is represented](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/graph-representation/a/representing-graphs).
> 2. You may assume that there are no duplicate edges in the input prerequisites.

拓扑排序。维护一个入度数组，再维护一个队列存储入度为0的点。

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def canFinish(self, numCourses: int, prerequisites: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
        inDegree = [0] * numCourses
        for pre in prerequisites:
            inDegree[pre[0]] += 1
        q = []
        for i in range(len(inDegree)):
            if inDegree[i] == 0:
                q.append(i)
        
        num = len(q)
        while len(q) > 0:
            source = q.pop()
            for pre in prerequisites:
                if pre[1] == source:
                    inDegree[pre[0]] -= 1
                    if inDegree[pre[0]] == 0:
                        num += 1
                        q.append(pre[0])
        if num != numCourses:
            return False
        return True
```
