# 63. Unique Paths II

> A robot is located at the top-left corner of a *m* x *n* grid (marked 'Start' in the diagram below).
>
> The robot can only move either down or right at any point in time. The robot is trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid (marked 'Finish' in the diagram below).
>
> Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

>
> An obstacle and empty space is marked as `1` and `0` respectively in the grid.
>
> **Note:** *m* and *n* will be at most 100.
>
> **Example 1:**

> ```
> Input:
> [
>   [0,0,0],
>   [0,1,0],
>   [0,0,0]
> ]
> Output: 2
> Explanation:
> There is one obstacle in the middle of the 3x3 grid above.
> There are two ways to reach the bottom-right corner:
> 1. Right -> Right -> Down -> Down
> 2. Down -> Down -> Right -> Right

动态规划，动态转移方程如下 (i, j > 0)：
$$
dp[0,i]=
\begin{cases}
0,&if\ G[0,i]==1\\
dp[0,i-1],&else
\end{cases}\\
dp[i,0]=
\begin{cases}
0,&if\ G[i,0]==1\\
dp[i-1,0],&else
\end{cases}\\
dp[i,j]=
\begin{cases}
0,&if\ G[i,j]==1\\
dp[i-1,j]+dp[i,j-1],&else
\end{cases}
$$
代码如下：

```python
import numpy as np
class Solution:
    def uniquePathsWithObstacles(self, obstacleGrid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        m = len(obstacleGrid)
        n = len(obstacleGrid[0])
        dp = np.zeros((m, n))
        dp[0, 0] = 1 if obstacleGrid[0][0] != 1 else 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[0, i] = dp[0, i-1] if obstacleGrid[0][i] != 1 else 0
        for i in range(1, m):
            dp[i, 0] = dp[i-1, 0] if obstacleGrid[i][0] != 1 else 0
        for i in range(1, m):
            for j in range(1, n):
                dp[i, j] = dp[i-1, j] + dp[i, j-1] if obstacleGrid[i][j] != 1 else 0
        return int(dp[m-1, n-1])
```
