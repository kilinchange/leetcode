# 86. Partition List

> Given a linked list and a value *x*, partition it such that all nodes less than *x* come before nodes greater than or equal to *x*.
>
> You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

> Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
> Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5

一边扫描链表，一边新建两条（改变next指针）链表分别表示值小于x的结点和不大于x的结点，最后合并两条新链表即可。

代码如下：

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def partition(self, head: ListNode, x: int) -> ListNode:
        if head == None:
            return head
        newHead = None
        front = None
        rearHead = None
        rear = None
        curr = head
        while curr != None:
            if curr.val < x:
                if front == None:
                    front = curr
                    newHead = curr
                else:
                    front.next = curr
                    front = front.next
            else:
                if rear == None:
                    rear = curr
                    rearHead = curr
                else:
                    rear.next = curr
                    rear = rear.next
            curr = curr.next
        if rear != None:
            rear.next = None
        if front != None:
            front.next = rearHead
        if newHead == None:
            newHead = rearHead
        return newHead
```
