# 299. Bulls and Cows

> You are playing the **[Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows)** game with your friend.
>
> You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:
>
> - The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
> - The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Specifically, the non-bull digits in the guess that could be rearranged such that they become bulls.
>
> Given the secret number `secret` and your friend's guess `guess`, return *the hint for your friend's guess*.
>
> The hint should be formatted as `"xAyB"`, where `x` is the number of bulls and `y` is the number of cows. Note that both `secret` and `guess` may contain duplicate digits.
>
>  
>
> **Example 1:**
>
> ```
> Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
> Output: "1A3B"
> Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
> "1807"
>   |
> "7810"
> ```
>
> **Example 2:**
>
> ```
> Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
> Output: "1A1B"
> Explanation: Bulls are connected with a '|' and cows are underlined:
> "1123"        "1123"
>   |      or     |
> "0111"        "0111"
> Note that only one of the two unmatched 1s is counted as a cow since the non-bull digits can only be rearranged to allow one 1 to be a bull.
> ```
>
> **Example 3:**
>
> ```
> Input: secret = "1", guess = "0"
> Output: "0A0B"
> ```
>
> **Example 4:**
>
> ```
> Input: secret = "1", guess = "1"
> Output: "1A0B"
> ```
>
>  
>
> **Constraints:**
>
> - `1 <= secret.length, guess.length <= 1000`
> - `secret.length == guess.length`
> - `secret` and `guess` consist of digits only.

解法一：

用两个数组mem1和mem2分别记录 secret 和 guess 的各个数字出现的次数，同时遍历两个数组每次取较小的那个数做加法，得到的和即为 secret 和 guess 出现的公共数字的个数（也是bulls 与 cows 的和）。

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def getHint(self, secret: str, guess: str) -> str:
        mem1 = [0] * 10
        mem2 = [0] * 10
        bulls = 0
        cows = 0
        for i in range(len(secret)):
            if secret[i] == guess[i]:
                bulls += 1
            mem1[int(secret[i])] += 1
            mem2[int(guess[i])] += 1
        for i in range(10):
            cows += min(mem1[i], mem2[i])
        cows -= bulls
        res = str(bulls) + 'A' + str(cows) + 'B'
        return res
```

解法二：

只使用一个数组 mem 记录数字出现的次数，同时遍历 secret 和 guess，其中 secret[i] 对 mem[secret[i]] 的贡献为 +1，guess[i] 对 mem[guess[i]] 的贡献为 -1。若当前 mem[k] 的值为正，说明截至目前 secret 中的 k 比 guess 多 mem[k] 个；反之说明 secret 中的 k 比 guess 少 -mem[k] 个。

代码如下：

```python
class Solution:
    def getHint(self, secret: str, guess: str) -> str:
        mem = [0] * 10
        bulls = 0
        cows = 0
        for i in range(len(secret)):
            s = int(secret[i])
            g = int(guess[i])
            if s == g:
                bulls += 1
            else:
                if mem[s] < 0:
                    cows += 1
                if mem[g] > 0:
                    cows += 1
            mem[s] += 1
            mem[g] -= 1
        return str(bulls) + 'A' + str(cows) + 'B'
```
